            <li>Photosensitivity is heightened skin sensitivity or an unusual reaction when your skin is exposed to UV
                radiation from sunlight or a tanning bed.</li>
            <li>There are two types of photosensitivity reactions: <ul>
                    <li>Phototoxic (most common)</li>
                    <li>Photoallergic (less common)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Phototoxic reactions occur when a drug is activated by UV light and causes damage to the skin that can
                look and feel like a sunburn or rash.</li>
            <li>Photoallergic reactions occur when UV rays interact with ingredients in medicines or products applied to
                the skin, causing the body's immune system to react.</li>
            <li>Photosensitivity can be caused by: <ul>
                    <li>Medications</li>
                    <li>Diseases and medical conditions</li>
                    <li>Skin-care products</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Some widely used medications that can cause photosensitivity include antibiotics, NSAIDs,
                antihistamines, heart medicines, and statins.</li>
            <li>Autoimmune diseases like lupus can make you hypersensitive to UV rays.</li>
            <li>Skin-care products containing retinols, glycolic acid, benzoyl peroxide, or vitamin C may cause
                photosensitivity.</li>
            <li>Photosensitivity reduces your natural defenses and elevates your risk for damage from the sun's harmful
                rays and potentially skin cancer.</li>
            <li>To treat a photosensitive reaction, follow similar steps as treating a sunburn. Seek medical attention
                if you develop flu-like symptoms or skin blisters.</li>
            <li>To prevent photosensitivity reactions: <ul>
                    <li>Minimize UV exposure</li>
                    <li>Wear protective clothing</li>
                    <li>Use broad-spectrum sunscreen</li>
                    <li>Check your skin regularly</li>

                        Skin cancer, the most common form of cancer in the United States, presents a serious health threat that demands heightened awareness and proactive measures for early detection. The Skin Cancer Foundation's initiative, The Big See, targets this need with a simple yet effective message centered on the words: NEW, CHANGING, and UNUSUAL. This initiative encourages individuals to conduct self-examinations of their skin once a month, looking for new moles or blemishes, spots that have changed in color, shape, size, or texture, and any skin anomalies that itch, hurt, crust, or bleed for more than three weeks. By focusing on these signs, The Big See aims to empower people to notice potentially harmful changes early on, which is crucial for timely intervention.<

                           Early detection is a pivotal factor in the successful treatment of skin cancer. Statistics reveal that more than two people die from skin cancer every hour in the U.S., highlighting the urgent need for increased vigilance and regular skin checks. The Big See's advocacy for monthly skin checks plays a vital role in educating the public about the importance of noticing and acting on abnormal skin changes. Moreover, the risk of developing melanoma, one of the most severe forms of skin cancer, doubles if an individual has had more than five sunburns in their lifetime. This statistic underscores the significance of protecting the skin from excessive sun exposure and the importance of early detection strategies promoted by initiatives like The Big See.</li>

                            Photosensitivity, or heightened skin sensitivity to UV radiation from sunlight or tanning beds, is another crucial aspect related to skin health. Individuals with photosensitivity may experience severe skin reactions such as phototoxic and photoallergic reactions. Phototoxic reactions, the more common type, can cause skin damage resembling a sunburn when drugs activated by UV light interact with the skin. On the other hand, photoallergic reactions involve a more complex immune system response when UV rays interact with certain substances on the skin, like ingredients in medications or skin-care products. Understanding and managing photosensitivity is essential, as it not only affects comfort but also increases the risk of skin damage and potentially, skin cancer.</li>
